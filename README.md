## Enterprise Threat Intelligence System

### Data Sources
- 200+ OSINT feeds
- Dark web monitoring
- Proprietary honeypot network
- Commercial intelligence partners

## Analysis Capabilities
1. **IOC Enrichment**: Contextual intelligence for indicators
2. **TTP Extraction**: Technique, tactic, procedure analysis
3. **Attribution Engine**: Threat actor identification
4. **Campaign Tracking**: Cross-incident correlation

## Detection Efficacy
| Threat Type | Detection Rate | False Positives |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Ransomware | 98.2% | 0.8% |
| APT | 95.7% | 1.2% |
| Credential Theft | 99.1% | 0.4% |
| Supply Chain | 93.4% | 1.5% |

## Integration Points
- **SIEM**: Splunk, QRadar, Elastic
- **SOAR**: Phantom, Demisto, Swimlane
- **EDR**: CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Carbon Black

## API Usage
```python
from threat_intel import ThreatIntel

ti = ThreatIntel(api_key="YOUR_KEY")

# Get threat context for IOC
result = ti.lookup_ip("192.168.1.1")
print(f"Threat score: {result.threat_score}")
print(f"Associated actors: {', '.join(result.actors)}")
```
